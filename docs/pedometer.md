In adults, physical activity confers benefits for the following health outcomes: improved
all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, incident hypertension, incident site-
specific cancers, 1 incident type-2 diabetes, mental health (reduced symptoms of anxiety
and depression); cognitive health, and sleep; measures of adiposity may also improve.
**Adults should undertake regular physical activity.**

Adults should do **at least 150‚Äì300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical
activity**; or at least 75‚Äì150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity;
or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity
**throughout the week, for substantial health benefits**.

Adults should also do **muscle-strengthening activities** at moderate or greater intensity
that involve all major muscle groups **on 2 or more days a week**, as these provide
additional health benefits.

## Good Practice
* Doing some physical activity is better than doing none.
* If adults are not meeting these recommendations, doing some physical activity will benefit their health.
* Adults should start by doing small amounts of physical activity, and gradually increase the frequency, intensity and duration over time.
