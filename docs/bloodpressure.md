**Blood pressure** is the measurement of the pressure or force of blood against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure is written as two numbers.

* **Systolic pressure** is the first number. It measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pushes blood out to your body.
* **Diastolic pressure** is the second number. It measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests between beats.

**Healthy blood pressure** for an adult, relaxed at rest, is **less than 120/80 mm Hg**.

## What can affect my blood pressure?

**Factors** that can affect your blood pressure reading include, but arenâ€™t limited to:

* Caffeine or beverages containing alcohol.
* Certain medications.
* Weight loss or weight gain.
* Cold temperatures.
* Exercise.
* A full bladder.
* A full stomach.
* The amount of salt in your diet.
* Smoking.
* Stress.

If youâ€™re measuring your blood pressure, remember these factors when reading your results. If someone else is taking your blood pressure, tell them about any factors that may affect your measurement.
