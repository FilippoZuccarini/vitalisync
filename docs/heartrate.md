    Don't forget to do some physical activity!

Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute when you’re at rest. A good time to check it is in the morning after you’ve had a good night’s sleep, before you get out of bed or grab that first cup of coffee.

## How do I get my heart rate in the target zone?

**There's a simple way to know if you're doing too much or not enough
during a workout.** Your target heart rate helps you hit the bullseye to
get the maximum benefit from every step, swing and squat. Even if you're
not a gym rat or elite athlete, knowing your heart rate (or pulse) can
help you track your health and fitness level.

## What is a resting heart rate?

**Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per
minute when you're at rest.** A good time to check it is in the morning
after you've had a good night's sleep, before you get out of bed or grab
that first cup of coffee.

## Is resting heart rate different by age?

**For most adults, a resting heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per
minute is normal.** However, the rate can be affected by factors such as
stress, anxiety, hormones, medication and how physically active you are.
An athlete or more active person may have a resting heart rate as low as
40 beats per minute. Now that's chill! 

**When it comes to resting heart rate, lower is better.** It usually
means your heart muscle is in better condition and doesn't have to work
as hard to keep a steady beat. Studies have found that a higher resting
heart rate is linked with lower physical fitness, higher blood pressure
and higher body weight. 

## Know Your Numbers: Maximum and Target Heart Rate by Age

This table shows target heart rate zones for different ages. Your
maximum heart rate is about 220 minus your age. 

In the age category closest to yours, read across to find your target
heart rates. Target heart rate during moderate-intensity activities is
about 50-70% of maximum heart rate. During vigorous physical activity,
it's about 70-85% of maximum. 

The figures are averages, so use them as a general guide.    
  
| Age       | Target HR Zone 50-85%  | Age-predicted Maximum Heart Rate |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- |
| 20 years  | 100-170 bpm  | 200 bpm |
| 30 years  | 95-162 bpm   | 190 bpm |
| 35 years  | 93-157 bpm   | 185 bpm |
