## What is a respiratory rate?

Your respiratory rate, or your breathing rate, is the **number of breaths you take per minute**. The normal respiratory rate for an adult at rest is **12 to 18 breaths per minute**. A respiration rate under 12 or over 25 breaths per minute while resting may be a sign of an underlying health condition.

## What conditions affect my respiratory rate?

Health conditions that can affect your respiratory rate include, but aren‚Äôt limited to, the following:

* Asthma.
* Anxiety.
* Pneumonia.
* Heart disease.
* Lung disease.
* Substance use disorder.

## Take care

Vital signs are important indicators of your overall health. Checking your vitals is the first step toward finding out what‚Äôs going on in your body. Vital signs let your care team know if you‚Äôre having a medical emergency or if there‚Äôs an underlying medical condition affecting your well-being. A healthcare provider will let you know if you need to check your vital signs at home regularly. Children usually don‚Äôt need their vitals checked outside of pediatric appointments. If your vital signs are abnormal or you have a question about how to take your vital signs, talk with a healthcare provider.
