    You're ok!

Healthy adults need at least **seven hours of sleep per night**. Babies, young children, and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and development. 

Knowing the general recommendations for **how much sleep you need** is a first step. Next, it is important to reflect on your individual needs based on factors like your **activity level and overall health**. And finally, of course, it is necessary to **apply healthy sleep tips** so that you can actually get the full nightâ€™s sleep that is recommended.

Deciding how much sleep you need means considering your **overall health**, **daily activities**, and typical **sleep patterns**. Some questions that you help assess your individual sleep needs include:

* Are you productive, healthy, and happy on seven hours of sleep? Or have you noticed that you require more hours of sleep to get into high gear?
* Do you have coexisting health issues that might require more rest?
* Do you have a high level of daily energy expenditure? Do you frequently play sports or work in a labor-intensive job?
* Do your daily activities require alertness to do them safely? Do you drive every day and/or operate heavy machinery? Do you ever feel sleepy when doing these activities?
* Are you experiencing or do you have a history of a sleep disorder?
* Do you depend on caffeine to get you through the day?
* When you have an open schedule, do you tend to sleep in more?

You can use your answers to these questions to hone in on your optimal amount of sleep.

## Start by making sleep a priority in your schedule.
This means budgeting for the hours you need so that work or social activities do not trade off with sleep. While cutting sleep short may be tempting in the moment, it does not pay off in the long run because sleep is essential for you to perform at your best, both mentally and physically.  

## Quality sleep matters too.
And it is possible to get the hours that you need but not feel refreshed because your sleep is fragmented or non-restorative. Fortunately, improving your bedroom setting and sleep-related habits, is an established way to get better rest. Examples of improvements include:

* **Improving your sleep hygiene**, which includes sticking to the same sleep schedule every day, even on weekends
* **Practicing a relaxing bedtime routine** to make it easier to fall asleep quickly
* **Choosing the best mattress** that is supportive and comfortable, and outfitting it with the best pillows and bedding.
* **Minimizing potential disruptions** from light and sound while optimizing your **bedroom temperature**
* **Disconnecting from electronic devices** like mobile phones and laptops for a half-hour or more before bed
* **Carefully monitoring your intake of caffeine and alcohol** and avoiding consumption in the hours before bed
