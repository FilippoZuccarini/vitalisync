## What is oxygen saturation?

**Oxygen saturation measures the percentage of oxyhemoglobin (oxygen-bound hemoglobin) in the blood**, and it is represented as arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). Oxygen saturation is a vital parameter to define blood oxygen content and oxygen delivery.

For adults, **the normal range of SaO2 is 95 â€“ 100%**. A value lower than 90% is considered low oxygen saturation, which requires external oxygen supplementation.

Measurement of oxygen saturation is particularly important for patients with health conditions that can reduce the level of oxygen in the blood. These conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, lung cancer, anemia, heart failure, heart attack, and other cardiopulmonary disorders.

## What happens when oxygen saturation drops?

A lower than normal level of oxygen in the blood is defined as **hypoxemia**. Generally, an oxygen saturation level of lower than 90% is considered as hypoxemia, which can result from cardiopulmonary complications, sleep apnea, certain medicines, and high-altitude exposure.

The most common symptoms of hypoxemia include headache, rapid heart rate, coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, confusion, and blueness of the skin and mucus membranes (cyanosis).  

## How to improve low oxygen saturation?

A drop in oxygen saturation below the critical level should be treated with **oxygen supplementation**. Depending on the severity of the condition, a physician can prescribe supplemental oxygen, which has the most direct effect on the oxygen saturation level.  

However, for mild-to-moderate conditions, there are natural ways to increase the level of blood oxygen saturation. For example, a **daily physical exercise can improve the lung capacity for gaseous exchange and protect against hypoxemia**. However, it is important to consult a physician before starting any exercise regimen or implementing changes in daily exercise routines.

**Eating a healthy and balanced diet** can also help improve blood oxygen saturation. Since iron deficiency is one of the major causes of low oxygen saturation, eating **foods that are rich in iron**, such as meat, fish, kidney beans, lentils, and cashew nuts, can be helpful.
